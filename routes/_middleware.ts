/**
 * Handles incoming requests to determine the appropriate language for the response.
 * If the request pathname starts with "/assets/", "/images/", or "/_frsh/", it bypasses
 * language detection and proceeds with the next middleware.
 * If the first segment of the pathname is a supported language, it sets the language
 * in the context state and proceeds with the next middleware.
 * Otherwise, it detects the preferred language from the "accept-language" header,
 * constructs a redirect URL with the detected language, and redirects the client.
 *
 * @param req - The incoming request object.
 * @param ctx - The FreshContext object containing the state and other context information.
 * @returns A Response object or a Promise that resolves to a Response object.
